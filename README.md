# COMPARISION-OF-MULTIPLE-HANDWRITTEN-DIGIT-RECOGNISION-MODELS-
Handwritten digit recognition is important in computer vision, used in OCR, document processing, and signature verification. With the MNIST dataset of 28x28 grayscale digit images, five models—SVM, Random Forest, CNN, RNN, and DBN—are trained, compared, and tested with real data to verify true accuracy.
