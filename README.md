# COMPARISION-OF-MULTIPLE-HANDWRITTEN-DIGIT-RECOGNISION-MODELS-
Handwritten digit recognition is important in computer vision, used in OCR, document processing, and signature verification. With the MNIST dataset of 28x28 grayscale digit images, five models—SVM, Random Forest, CNN, RNN, and DBN—are trained, compared, and tested with real data to verify true accuracy.


Handwritten digit recognition is a fundamental task in computer vision and has numerous applications, including optical character recognition (OCR), digitized document processing, and signature verification. The application is built using Python with the support of ‘MNIST database’. MNSIT database consists of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9), with a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples.

The Models implemented and compared are ‘SVM’, ‘Random Forest’, ‘CNN’, ‘RNN’, ‘DBN’. These Models are trained using a standardized methodology, such as cross-validation or train-test splits, to ensure fair comparison. The project also aims at testing the model with actual data to compare the accuracy of the model with actual data and the accuracy the model claims to have.

The conclusions are based on the comparative analysis and providing recommendations for selecting the most suitable model for handwritten digit recognition based on specific use cases or requirements. The project aims to provide valuable insights into the performance and suitability of various machine learning models for handwritten digit recognition, aiding practitioners, and researchers in choosing the appropriate model for their applications.
